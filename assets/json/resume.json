    "summary": "I am working to utilise enabling digital technologies and their transformative potential in areas such as land and water conservation. For this I have experience using a two-fold approach, (i) Trend forecasting and landscaping of patent grants and using information engineering practices for state-of-the-art emerging technology analytics, and understanding competitive trends for disruptive innovation opportunities, and (ii) Engaging in bringing social change by further prototyping technology stack and its key components, creating High-Level Designs (HLD), and implementing hardware, software, and data engineering perspectives, empowering a wide user-base.",
