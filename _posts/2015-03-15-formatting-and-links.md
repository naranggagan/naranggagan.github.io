title: Urgent Need for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Digital Strategies

Recent instances of heavy rainfall in various parts of the world, such as South Korea, the United States, and India, have highlighted the pressing need for understanding and addressing the causes and consequences of climate change. In many developing countries, the lack of adequate infrastructure exacerbates the impacts of extreme weather events, with countries like Pakistan already on high alert.

Climate change is characterized by rising global temperatures, leading to increased evaporation rates and atmospheric moisture levels. Last month, June was recorded as the hottest ever, followed by July with flooding in many parts of the world. These changes result in intense rain systems and extreme weather events. Addressing climate change requires a comprehensive approach, including mitigation and adaptation strategies (Figure 1). While mitigation efforts aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation initiatives are equally crucial in helping communities and ecosystems cope with the impacts of climate change. However, current investment in climate adaptation is inadequate, despite the significant economic benefits it can bring.

#### Climate Adaptation Initiatives

What is meant by "climate adaptation initiatives"? Countries, cities, and businesses need to move simultaneously along two paths: reducing emissions dramatically (mitigation) and investing in resilience while planning for vast and impending change (adaptation).

It is rightly said that "Mitigation helps us avoid the unmanageable, while adaptation helps us manage the unavoidable." The authors of a Harvard Business Review article argue that climate adaptation initiatives deserve more significant investment in the present-day scenario, especially considering the potential economic benefits associated with it (Chidambaram & Khanna, 2022). While companies are committing to reducing carbon emissions and water consumption, these actions only prevent a worse future and do not address the consequences of existing damage. Climate adaptation, which aims to help people, animals, and plants survive in the face of climate volatility, receives only 7% of climate-related investment despite offering near-term opportunities with lower capital expenditures and faster paybacks. For example, water-related adaptation interventions like groundwater monitoring and precision irrigation techniques in peri-urban areas can help address water scarcity in major cities.

Investing large sums immediately in physical infrastructure can be expensive for developing countries. However, I believe that investing in smaller-scale solutions such as real-time monitoring, data collection, and efficient planning not only offers a more cost-effective approach but also enables better-informed decisions for optimizing infrastructure investments. Therefore, to effectively address the challenges of climate change, digital technology inclusion plays a crucial role in facilitating the shift from short-term management to long-term strategic planning. These technologies enable data-driven approaches that provide valuable insights for informed decision-making. For example, the use of artificial intelligence can analyze and monitor various climate-related parameters, such as groundwater levels, to support sustainable water management practices.

Our team currently works in this direction, addressing the problem through a niche methodology of using data-driven approaches to forecast groundwater levels (GWL) using artificial intelligence in central Italy (Galdelli et al., 2023). The collaboration extends by cooperating with the Department of Urban Planning. Such data-driven approaches and co-working with strategic planning stakeholders, utilizing groundwater, weather, and satellite data, can greatly aid in climate change adaptation strategies. By analyzing and monitoring GWL, governments and communities can make informed decisions regarding sustainable water management practices. Integration of digital technologies can enhance the capacity to prioritize the interests of society and nature, hold stakeholders accountable, and advocate for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

Addressing climate change requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses both mitigation and adaptation strategies, as presented. Digital technologies play a significant role in enabling effective climate adaptation initiatives. Moreover, by embracing long-term strategic planning governance models and utilizing digital tools, stakeholders can prioritize society and nature while holding businesses and governments accountable for their social and ecological impacts. In the aftermath of natural calamities like floods, there is often a blame game between corporations, governments, and citizens, highlighting the need for accurate information and data. However, the effective implementation of technology can serve as an unbiased source of raw data, bringing an end to these debates and facilitating informed decision-making. The integration of digital technologies empowers decision-makers with accurate and timely data, enabling them to make informed choices and work towards a more sustainable and resilient future in the face of climate change.
