description: My published research lies at the nexus of engineering, artificial intelligence, and data-driven strategic management. I have contributed to Q1 journals in AI—including Pattern Recognition Letters and the Journal of Big Data—as well as to A* conferences in computer science and robotics, such as the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2025. On the management side, my work has appeared in Q1 journals like Technological Forecasting and Social Change and IEEE Engineering Management Review, and I am now preparing interdisciplinary research for FT50 journals such as Research Policy.With a strong interdisciplinary interest, I aim to extend engineering research methodologies to domains that have yet to fully leverage the benefits of AI—such as policy design, innovation strategy, and the social sciences. Below is a selection of published and in-progress work across applications of general interest:
