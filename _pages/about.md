I am a doctoral in training at the Vision Robotics Artificial Intelligence (VRAI) lab of the Università Politecnica delle Marche in Ancona, Italy. With a research background in interdisciplinary computational science, I have demonstrated a holistic approach to problem-solving. I actively engage in research activities and have a strong interest in data-driven emerging technologies for positive social change. Currently, my research focuses on using artificial intelligence for water resource conservation. I have experience in technology orchestration, including data collection, analytics, and system development, gained through academic, research, teaching, and industry collaborations. My long-term goal is to translate technological advancements into tangible social welfare outcomes.

Please feel free to reach out to me, if you have any project or business ideas. I am always looking forward to external collaborations that focus on innovation, technology adoption and social welfare.
