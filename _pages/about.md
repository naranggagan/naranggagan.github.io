I am a PhD student at the Vision Robotics Artificial Intelligence (VRAI) lab of the Università Politecnica delle Marche in Ancona, Italy, currently visiting KU Leuven, Belgium. My research explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and strategic technological forecasting, with a focus on data-driven approaches for decision-making in fast-evolving sectors.

I have experience working at the industry-academic interface through collaborations and internships, including a recent academic internship at Jef Digital Innovation S.r.l. My work involves orchestrating technology across data pipelines, integrating structured and unstructured information to develop forecasting models and design strategic solutions.

I am particularly interested in applying AI and time series analysis to sustainability, mobility, and smart infrastructure. I actively contribute to interdisciplinary research, curriculum design, and international collaborations, and my broader mission is to ensure technological innovation translates into impactful outcomes for society.

Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborations at the intersection of innovation, AI, and public good.
